For my sixth WOD I had to create a Invoice using HTML and Javascript, which in this case the HTML and Javascript worked together to execute the calculations of the Invoice. Here is a link to the intructions and the outcome that was expected https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-expressions-operators.html 

For this WOD I had clear steps I had in mind in order to execute it. 

The first thing I did was read through the instruction thoroughly and find out what is expected for the final product. Reading the instructions first helps me identify what parts of my notes I need to refer back to when doing the WOD so that I am not wasting time looking for it when I actually try it. This also helps me paint a bigger picture of what all the steps are building up. This way I can see what parts connect to eachother and how they affect the overall product.

Next thing that I do is actually attempt it and try to execute it before the DNF time. While doing the WOD, I take notes on parts I had difficulty time and what took the longest to do. I usually go over DNF time my first attempt since it takes time for me to figure what coding syntax is right and I often times bump into a bunch of technical errors.

After my first attempt I watch the solutions and refer back to my previous notes on parts that I had difficulty time on and write in the solutions for them. When watching the screenscast I don't try to simultanously do the WOD. Instead I watch it to learn from my mistakes and make sure that I take good notes so that I don't make the same mistakes when I re-attempt it.

Then I would re-attempt the WOD with my notes open on the side. I would not start the recording until I know for sure that I am confident that I could do the WOD without any technical errors. 

After confidently mastering the WOD, I would do the last step, which is recording myself doing the WOD. I have a hard time doing the recording part since for some reason, one or two things happen while recording; I find technical errors that were not there before and have to solve them during the recording or my surrounding become unbearable distracting and noisy, I would have to restart (if possible, please find a quite place to record your WOD, it's not worth restarting a 30 min recording again)

In order to prepare for my WOD, of course I made sure I read the readings and watch the screencast ( or atleast skim it). Then I usually set asside 2 hours of my day to do it. I like to take my time with my WOD, usually when I rush it I make more mistakes  and it would take more of my time. Knowing that I can slowly take my time makes me more at ease and focused.

I think I could have done better during my actual recording. I should have taken a step back from recording and came back to it after my third attempt. Usually when I get frustrate (expecially when I am recording) I would often make stupid mistakes. Maybe taking a breather next time would do me good since this WOD took about 4 times to record because of my frustration.
