Browser History1 was fairly easy to figure out since for my ICS 101 class we had to make a basic website for our final project. However, I think I fell short with going into the recording without actualy doing the WOD pre-recording. This made me re-do the recordings atleast five times because I went over time trying to figure out minor hiccups hear and there. This resulted in a lot of frustration because I had to do the same things over-and-over again. Overall, my first WOD recording took an unneccessary 3 hours to do because I failed to correct minor problems before the recording. Always try it once before doing the recording or else you will be in the same situation as me.

For Browser History 2, I made the mistake of not looking at the recording after failing once. I have a habit of trying to figure things out myself until I get it right. After failing twice while still working over DNF time I finally caved in and watched the youtube video tutorial. While watching the youtube video I did not try to simultounously do the WOD, instead I took notes of the video and on parts that I was having difficulties on. After watching the video and taking notes I then proceeded to do my recording and the WOD. I didn't attempt to do the WOD pre-recording becuase I've done the WOD twice so I was confident on the other parts and had my notes to help me on parts I was stuck on it.
Don't be stubborn and watch the tutorial of the solution. It will save you plenty of time!!  Also, don't try to attempt to do the WOD while watching the solution, take notes and learn from your mistake. It will take time, but honeslty, its better to learn it now rather than going back and re-watching the solution again cause you didn't learn the first time. Lastly, give up if you hit the DNF time and watch the solution. If you don't get it within the time, that means there a part of the lessom you are not getting, and that is okay, cause it's all new.

Browser History 3 I learned from my mistakes. It did take me three times, but that was my fault. I was trying to rush it and kept hitting minor errors that could've been easily resolved if I was fully engaged with the WOD. If you plan to do a WOD, make sure you look at the DNF time and multiply it by 3, that is how long it may take you to do it, taking into consideration that you may fail your first/second try, plus watch the recoring, and then actually recording the whole WOD. That's my rule of thumb, but you may have a different way of tackling the WODs.
